	Klotski installation instructions


Klotski requires Python, Qt (v2.2) and PyQt (v2.1) to run.


UNIX users:
===========

- Qt: 
The Qt from Kde 2 is ok. Else, you can download from here:
http://www.trolltech.com

- Python:
I tested klotski with python 1.5.2 . I guess it works with other versions of the
python interpreter.

- PyQt:
You'll need PyQt v2.1 or higher to make Klotski run (v2.0 doesn't work). You
can download it from http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde/download.php3 .
But because it takes hours to compile, I'll try to provide a shared library
compiled for x86, which should work in most of the cases.

- Normal installation:
To install klotski, just type 'make install'. 
Then type 'klotski' to run klotski. 

You can change the default installation location of klotski (/usr/local/... ) 
by editing the Makefile and changing the prefix variable.


Windows users:
==============

Klotski for windows requires the following programs to be installed:

- Python:
I tested Klotski only with python 1.6 . You can download it 
from http://www.python.org/1.6/download_win.html.

- Qt and PyQt:
PyQt for windows contains Qt and you can download it from
http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde/download.php3

Installation:
There is no specific installation instructions for windows. Just run
klotski.bat to launch klotski. If it doesn't while python and PyQt are there,
it is probably because it can't find them. In klotski.bat, uncomment the lines setting the path and edit them te reflect your installation.


Remarks:
========

There is a standard module in python to handle installation of python programs
(DistUtils) but I didn't find how to install data files with this. So I just
used a good old makefile to handle all this. If you know a better way to
handle all this, please tell me.
