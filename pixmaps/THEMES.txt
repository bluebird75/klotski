				Tile themes
	

Adding a new tile theme is really simple. You just need to replace the file
klotski-tiles.png with an image of your tiles. I would be glad to include it
in a future version of klotski.


Theme file organisation:
========================
To generate a new theme, enter the pixmap dir and look around:

There are five kind of tiles (walls, special walls, pieces, main piece, goal)
and each one has its own directory, in which its graphic is defined. 

In these directory, you will always find the same files :
inner.xpm
hor_edge.xpm
ver_edge.xpm
corner.xpm
miss_corner.xpm

In klotski, each piece is composed of one or many tiles. A tile is the
smallest possible piece, i.e. a simple square. 

A tile, is composed of four quarters : top-left, top-right,
bottom-left and bottom-right. The quarter which will be drawn is chosen
according to the shape of the piece, or put differently, according to the
neighbours of the current tile. 

Each pixmap contains the four quarters used to draw a tile. All the
possible configuration are handled with the provided files.


Imagine we are drawing the quarter X of our tile 't'. We are going to
choose the quarter according to the type of the tiles 1, 2, 3.

  11 22
  11 22
  
  33 Xt
  33 tt



Possible quarters are :

inner:

  tt tt
  tt tt
  
  tt Xt
  tt tt

Our quarter is in the center of a big tile.


 
 
hor_edge:

  aa bb
  aa bb
  
  tt Xt
  tt tt

Our quarter is at an horizontal edge of the tile.


  
ver_edge:

  aa tt
  aa tt
  
  cc Xt
  cc tt
  
Our quarter is at a vertical edge of the tile.




corner:

  aa bb
  aa bb
  
  cc Xt
  cc tt

Our quarter is in the corner of the tile.



miss-corner:

  aa tt
  aa tt
  
  tt Xt
  tt tt

Our quarter is in an inner corner of the tile.



Once the pixmap file is choosen, I just copy the top-left quarter of it 
to the tile. For the other quarters, I use exactly the same process
except that the neighbours I check are not the same.


So if you understood all that and if you are a graphist, it should be fairly
easy for you to do a new theme.  Just override the existing pixmaps and run
"python generate.py" to produce a new klotski-tiles.png .

The color (0,0,0) is the transparent color for the tiles and the size of a
tile is currently 32x32. But these parameters can be changed by editing the file
enum.py
